# Taking-advantage-of-dices
Evaluation on behaviors with the peak value of rolling multiple dices.

DnD(Dungeons & Dragons)-like CRPG heavily rely on rolling dice, applying them to almost every in-game action. Simple as it may seem, probability distribution for rolling a single dice should be Math 101 for everyone. However, there is an interesting term called "granting advantage", which simply means rolling two dices and pick the high value as the result.

- Graph for expectation scales with the available re-rolling times.
- Numerical distribution difference wi/o "granting advantage".
  - Can we stimulate the process of rolling multiple dice to a numerical shift to the original case (to reduce entropy cost)?
